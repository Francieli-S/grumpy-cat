# Project - Grumpy Cat

# Description

Grumpy Cat is a game where the player has to move the cat, which is positioned horizontally at the bottom and try to react to the items that come from the top. Catch the treats increment the score, catching the chocolates decrement the score, and catching the other items, like cups, makes the cat loses one of its seven lives.

# MVP (DOM - CANVAS)

- game starts with the game sleeping
- the game has a cat at the bottom that moves horizontally
- as soon he moves, things come from top to bottom
- these things are: treats, chocolates, and cups
- catch treats increment the score
- catch chocolates decrement the score
- catch a cup ends the game

# Backlog

- add the ability to cat use its paw to hit the cup and increment two times the score
- add Tv controls to work the same way as the cups
